# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
The following were done during the analysis of the project:
1. Download the UCI HAR Dataset
2. Load and run the features.txt and activity_labels.txt which contain the activity names and activity labels, respectively. 
3. Extract the means and standard deviations from the activity names.
4. Load and run the datasets of training and test datasets together with their respective labels and subjects.
5. Merge the training and test datasets using the cbind and rbind. 
6. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
